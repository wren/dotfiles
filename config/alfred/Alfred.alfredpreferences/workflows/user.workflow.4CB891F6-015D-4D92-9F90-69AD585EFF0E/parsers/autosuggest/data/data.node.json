This is extremely rare, and generally can only happen during development of Node.js itself. 4 Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure: The JavaScript source code internal in the Node.js bootstrapping process failed to return a function value when evaluated. This is extremely rare, and generally can only happen during development of Node.js itself. 5 Fatal Error: There was a fatal unrecoverable error in V8. Typically a message will be printed to stderr with the prefix FATAL ERROR. 6 Non-function Internal Exception Handler: There was an uncaught exception, but the internal fatal exception handler function was somehow set to a non-function, and could not be called. 7 Internal Exception Handler Run-Time Failure: There was an uncaught exception, and the internal fatal exception handler function itself threw an error while attempting to handle it. This can happen, for example, if an 'uncaughtException' or domain.on('error') handler throws an error. 8: Unused. In previous versions of Node.js, exit code 8 sometimes indicated an uncaught exception. 9 Invalid Argument: Either an unknown option was specified, or an option requiring a value was provided without a value. 10 Internal JavaScript Run-Time Failure: The JavaScript source code internal in the Node.js bootstrapping process threw an error when the bootstrapping function was called.

This is a standard POSIX practice, since exit codes are defined to be 7-bit integers, and signal exits set the high-order bit, and then contain the value of the signal code.

The require() function can load Addons as ordinary Node.js modules. Addons provide an interface between JavaScript and C\/C++ libraries. There are three options for implementing Addons: N-API, nan, or direct use of internal V8, libuv and Node.js libraries. Unless there is a need for direct access to functionality which is not exposed by N-API, use N-API. Refer to C\/C++ Addons with N-API for more information on N-API. When not using N-API, implementing Addons is complicated, involving knowledge of several components and APIs:   V8: the C++ library Node.js uses to provide the JavaScript implementation. V8 provides the mechanisms for creating objects, calling functions, etc. V8's API is documented mostly in the v8.h header file (deps\/v8\/include\/v8.h in the Node.js source tree), which is also available online.   libuv: The C library that implements the Node.js event loop, its worker threads and all of the asynchronous behaviors of the platform. It also serves as a cross-platform abstraction library, giving easy, POSIX-like access across all major operating systems to many common system tasks, such as interacting with the filesystem, sockets, timers, and system events. libuv also provides a pthreads-like threading abstraction that may be used to power more sophisticated asynchronous Addons that need to move beyond the standard event loop. Addon authors are encouraged to think about how to avoid blocking the event loop with I\/O or other time-intensive tasks by off-loading work via libuv to non-blocking system operations, worker threads or a custom use of libuv's threads.   Internal Node.js libraries. Node.js itself exports C++ APIs that Addons can use, the most important of which is the node::ObjectWrap class.   Node.js includes other statically linked libraries including OpenSSL. These other libraries are located in the deps\/ directory in the Node.js source tree. Only the libuv, OpenSSL, V8 and zlib symbols are purposefully re-exported by Node.js and may be used to various extents by Addons. See Linking to libraries included with Node.js for additional information.

For example, the Electron runtime runs multiple instances of Node.js in a single process. Each instance will have its own require() cache, and thus each instance will need a native addon to behave correctly when loaded via require(). From the addon's perspective, this means that it must support multiple initializations. A context-aware addon can be constructed by using the macro NODE_MODULE_INITIALIZER, which expands to the name of a function which Node.js will expect to find when it loads an addon. An addon can thus be initialized as in the following example: using namespace v8;  extern \"C\" NODE_MODULE_EXPORT void NODE_MODULE_INITIALIZER(Local<Object> exports,                         Local<Value> module,                         Local<Context> context) {   \/* Perform addon initialization steps here. *\/ }  Another option is to use the macro NODE_MODULE_INIT(), which will also construct a context-aware addon. Unlike NODE_MODULE(), which is used to construct an addon around a given addon initializer function, NODE_MODULE_INIT() serves as the declaration of such an initializer to be followed by a function body. The following three variables may be used inside the function body following an invocation of NODE_MODULE_INIT():  Local<Object> exports, Local<Value> module, and Local<Context> context  The choice to build a context-aware addon carries with it the responsibility of carefully managing global static data. Since the addon may be loaded multiple times, potentially even from different threads, any global static data stored in the addon must be properly protected, and must not contain any persistent references to JavaScript objects. The reason for this is that JavaScript objects are only valid in one context, and will likely cause a crash when accessed from the wrong context or from a different thread than the one on which they were created. The context-aware addon can be structured to avoid global static data by performing the following steps:   Define a class which will hold per-addon-instance data and which has a static member of the form static void DeleteInstance(void* data) {   \/\/ Cast `data` to an instance of the class and delete it. }   Heap-allocate an instance of this class in the addon initializer. This can be accomplished using the new keyword. Call node::AddEnvironmentCleanupHook(), passing it the above-created instance and a pointer to DeleteInstance(). This will ensure the instance is deleted when the environment is torn down. Store the instance of the class in a v8::External, and Pass the v8::External to all methods exposed to JavaScript by passing it to v8::FunctionTemplate::New() or v8::Function::New() which creates the native-backed JavaScript functions. The third parameter of v8::FunctionTemplate::New() or v8::Function::New()  accepts the v8::External and makes it available in the native callback using the v8::FunctionCallbackInfo::Data() method.  This will ensure that the per-addon-instance data reaches each binding that can be called from JavaScript. The per-addon-instance data must also be passed into any asynchronous callbacks the addon may create. The following example illustrates the implementation of a context-aware addon: #include <node.h>  using namespace v8;  class AddonData {  public:   explicit AddonData(Isolate* isolate):       call_count(0) {     \/\/ Ensure this per-addon-instance data is deleted at environment cleanup.     node::AddEnvironmentCleanupHook(isolate, DeleteInstance, this);   }    \/\/ Per-addon data.   int call_count;    static void DeleteInstance(void* data) {     delete static_cast<AddonData*>(data);   } };  static void Method(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& info) {   \/\/ Retrieve the per-addon-instance data.   AddonData* data =       reinterpret_cast<AddonData*>(info.Data().As<External>()->Value());   data->call_count++;   info.GetReturnValue().Set((double)data->call_count); }  \/\/ Initialize this addon to be context-aware.

Local<External> external = External::New(isolate, data);    \/\/ Expose the method `Method` to JavaScript, and make sure it receives the   \/\/ per-addon-instance data we created above by passing `external` as the   \/\/ third parameter to the `FunctionTemplate` constructor.   exports->Set(context,                String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, \"method\", NewStringType::kNormal)                   .ToLocalChecked(),                FunctionTemplate::New(isolate, Method, external)                   ->GetFunction(context).ToLocalChecked()).FromJust(); }"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_worker_support","title":"Worker support","description":"In order to be loaded from multiple Node.js environments, such as a main thread and a Worker thread, an add-on needs to either:  Be an N-API addon, or Be declared as context-aware using NODE_MODULE_INIT() as described above  In order to support Worker threads, addons need to clean up any resources they may have allocated when such a thread exists. This can be achieved through the usage of the AddEnvironmentCleanupHook() function: void AddEnvironmentCleanupHook(v8::Isolate* isolate,                                void (*fun)(void* arg),                                void* arg);  This function adds a hook that will run before a given Node.js instance shuts down.

To do so, create a file called binding.gyp in the top-level of the project describing the build configuration of the module using a JSON-like format. This file is used by node-gyp, a tool written specifically to compile Node.js Addons. {   \"targets\": [     {       \"target_name\": \"addon\",       \"sources\": [ \"hello.cc\" ]     }   ] }  A version of the node-gyp utility is bundled and distributed with Node.js as part of npm. This version is not made directly available for developers to use and is intended only to support the ability to use the npm install command to compile and install Addons. Developers who wish to use node-gyp directly can install it using the command npm install -g node-gyp. See the node-gyp installation instructions for more information, including platform-specific requirements. Once the binding.gyp file has been created, use node-gyp configure to generate the appropriate project build files for the current platform. This will generate either a Makefile (on Unix platforms) or a vcxproj file (on Windows) in the build\/ directory. Next, invoke the node-gyp build command to generate the compiled addon.node file. This will be put into the build\/Release\/ directory. When using npm install to install a Node.js Addon, npm uses its own bundled version of node-gyp to perform this same set of actions, generating a compiled version of the Addon for the user's platform on demand. Once built, the binary Addon can be used from within Node.js by pointing require() to the built addon.node module: \/\/ hello.js const addon = require('.\/build\/Release\/addon');  console.log(addon.hello()); \/\/ Prints: 'world'  Because the exact path to the compiled Addon binary can vary depending on how it is compiled (i.e. sometimes it may be in .\/build\/Debug\/), Addons can use the bindings package to load the compiled module. While the bindings package implementation is more sophisticated in how it locates Addon modules, it is essentially using a try\u2026catch pattern similar to: try {   return require('.\/build\/Release\/addon.node'); } catch (err) {   return require('.\/build\/Debug\/addon.node'); }"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_linking_to_libraries_included_with_node_js","title":"Linking to libraries included with Node.js","description":"Node.js uses statically linked libraries such as V8, libuv and OpenSSL.

However, there are a few caveats to be aware of:   When node-gyp runs, it will detect the specific release version of Node.js and download either the full source tarball or just the headers. If the full source is downloaded, Addons will have complete access to the full set of Node.js dependencies. However, if only the Node.js headers are downloaded, then only the symbols exported by Node.js will be available.   node-gyp can be run using the --nodedir flag pointing at a local Node.js source image.

It is independent from the underlying JavaScript runtime (for example, V8) and is maintained as part of Node.js itself. This API will be Application Binary Interface (ABI) stable across versions of Node.js. It is intended to insulate Addons from changes in the underlying JavaScript engine and allow modules compiled for one major version to run on later major versions of Node.js without recompilation. The ABI Stability guide provides a more in-depth explanation. Addons are built\/packaged with the same approach\/tools outlined in the section titled C++ Addons. The only difference is the set of APIs that are used by the native code. Instead of using the V8 or Native Abstractions for Node.js APIs, the functions available in the N-API are used. APIs exposed by N-API are generally used to create and manipulate JavaScript values. Concepts and operations generally map to ideas specified in the ECMA-262 Language Specification. The APIs have the following properties:  All N-API calls return a status code of type napi_status. This status indicates whether the API call succeeded or failed. The API's return value is passed via an out parameter. All JavaScript values are abstracted behind an opaque type named napi_value. In case of an error status code, additional information can be obtained using napi_get_last_error_info. More information can be found in the error handling section Error Handling.  The N-API is a C API that ensures ABI stability across Node.js versions and different compiler levels. A C++ API can be easier to use. To support using C++, the project maintains a C++ wrapper module called node-addon-api. This wrapper provides an inlineable C++ API. Binaries built with node-addon-api will depend on the symbols for the N-API C-based functions exported by Node.js. node-addon-api is a more efficient way to write code that calls N-API. Take, for example, the following node-addon-api code. The first section shows the node-addon-api code and the second section shows what actually gets used in the addon. Object obj = Object::New(env); obj[\"foo\"] = String::New(env, \"bar\");  napi_status status; napi_value object, string; status = napi_create_object(env, &object); if (status != napi_ok) {   napi_throw_error(env, ...);   return; }  status = napi_create_string_utf8(env, \"bar\", NAPI_AUTO_LENGTH, &string); if (status != napi_ok) {   napi_throw_error(env, ...);   return; }  status = napi_set_named_property(env, object, \"foo\", string); if (status != napi_ok) {   napi_throw_error(env, ...);   return; }  The end result is that the addon only uses the exported C APIs. As a result, it still gets the benefits of the ABI stability provided by the C API. When using node-addon-api instead of the C APIs, start with the API docs for node-addon-api."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_implications_of_abi_stability","title":"Implications of ABI Stability","description":"Although N-API provides an ABI stability guarantee, other parts of Node.js do not, and any external libraries used from the addon may not. In particular, none of the following APIs provide an ABI stability guarantee across major versions:   the Node.js C++ APIs available via any of #include <node.h> #include <node_buffer.h> #include <node_version.h> #include <node_object_wrap.h>    the libuv APIs which are also included with Node.js and available via #include <uv.h>    the V8 API available via #include <v8.h>    Thus, for an addon to remain ABI-compatible across Node.js major versions, it must make use exclusively of N-API by restricting itself to using #include <node_api.h>  and by checking, for all external libraries that it uses, that the external library makes ABI stability guarantees similar to N-API."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_building","title":"Building","description":"Unlike modules written in JavaScript, developing and deploying Node.js native addons using N-API requires an additional set of tools.

In the example below, addon.c and addon.h refer only to js_native_api.h. This ensures that addon.c can be reused to compile against either the Node.js implementation of N-API or any implementation of N-API outside of Node.js. addon_node.c is a separate file that contains the Node.js specific entry point to the addon and which instantiates the addon by calling into addon.c when the addon is loaded into a Node.js environment. \/\/ addon.h #ifndef _ADDON_H_ #define _ADDON_H_ #include <js_native_api.h> napi_value create_addon(napi_env env); #endif  \/\/ _ADDON_H_  \/\/ addon.c #include \"addon.h\"  #define NAPI_CALL(env, call)                                      \\   do {                                                            \\     napi_status status = (call);                                  \\     if (status != napi_ok) {                                      \\       const napi_extended_error_info* error_info = NULL;          \\       napi_get_last_error_info((env), &error_info);               \\       bool is_pending;                                            \\       napi_is_exception_pending((env), &is_pending);              \\       if (!is_pending) {                                          \\         const char* message = (error_info->error_message == NULL) \\             ? \"empty error message\"                               \\             : error_info->error_message;                          \\         napi_throw_error((env), NULL, message);                   \\         return NULL;                                              \\       }                                                           \\     }                                                             \\   } while(0)  static napi_value DoSomethingUseful(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info) {   \/\/ Do something useful.   return NULL; }  napi_value create_addon(napi_env env) {   napi_value result;   NAPI_CALL(env, napi_create_object(env, &result));    napi_value exported_function;   NAPI_CALL(env, napi_create_function(env,                                       \"doSomethingUseful\",                                       NAPI_AUTO_LENGTH,                                       DoSomethingUseful,                                       NULL,                                       &exported_function));    NAPI_CALL(env, napi_set_named_property(env,                                          result,                                          \"doSomethingUseful\",                                          exported_function));    return result; }  \/\/ addon_node.c #include <node_api.h> #include \"addon.h\"  NAPI_MODULE_INIT() {   \/\/ This function body is expected to return a `napi_value`.   \/\/ The variables `napi_env env` and `napi_value exports` may be used within   \/\/ the body, as they are provided by the definition of `NAPI_MODULE_INIT()`.   return create_addon(env); }"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_environment_life_cycle_apis","title":"Environment Life Cycle APIs","description":"Section 8.7 of the ECMAScript Language Specification defines the concept of an \"Agent\" as a self-contained environment in which JavaScript code runs. Multiple such Agents may be started and terminated either concurrently or in sequence by the process. A Node.js environment corresponds to an ECMAScript Agent. In the main process, an environment is created at startup, and additional environments can be created on separate threads to serve as worker threads. When Node.js is embedded in another application, the main thread of the application may also construct and destroy a Node.js environment multiple times during the life cycle of the application process such that each Node.js environment created by the application may, in turn, during its life cycle create and destroy additional environments as worker threads. From the perspective of a native addon this means that the bindings it provides may be called multiple times, from multiple contexts, and even concurrently from multiple threads. Native addons may need to allocate global state of which they make use during their entire life cycle such that the state must be unique to each instance of the addon.

In cases where a return value other than napi_ok or napi_pending_exception is returned, napi_is_exception_pending must be called to check if an exception is pending. See the section on exceptions for more details. The full set of possible napi_status values is defined in napi_api_types.h. The napi_status return value provides a VM-independent representation of the error which occurred. In some cases it is useful to be able to get more detailed information, including a string representing the error as well as VM (engine)-specific information.

This is the case for any of the API functions, even those that may not cause the execution of JavaScript. If the napi_status returned by a function is napi_ok then no exception is pending and no additional action is required. If the napi_status returned is anything other than napi_ok or napi_pending_exception, in order to try to recover and continue instead of simply returning immediately, napi_is_exception_pending must be called in order to determine if an exception is pending or not. In many cases when an N-API function is called and an exception is already pending, the function will return immediately with a napi_status of napi_pending_exception. However, this is not the case for all functions. N-API allows a subset of the functions to be called to allow for some minimal cleanup before returning to JavaScript. In that case, napi_status will reflect the status for the function. It will not reflect previous pending exceptions. To avoid confusion, check the error status after every function call. When an exception is pending one of two approaches can be employed. The first approach is to do any appropriate cleanup and then return so that execution will return to JavaScript. As part of the transition back to JavaScript, the exception will be thrown at the point in the JavaScript code where the native method was invoked. The behavior of most N-API calls is unspecified while an exception is pending, and many will simply return napi_pending_exception, so do as little as possible and then return to JavaScript where the exception can be handled. The second approach is to try to handle the exception. There will be cases where the native code can catch the exception, take the appropriate action, and then continue. This is only recommended in specific cases where it is known that the exception can be safely handled. In these cases napi_get_and_clear_last_exception can be used to get and clear the exception. On success, result will contain the handle to the last JavaScript Object thrown. If it is determined, after retrieving the exception, the exception cannot be handled after all it can be re-thrown it with napi_throw where error is the JavaScript Error object to be thrown. The following utility functions are also available in case native code needs to throw an exception or determine if a napi_value is an instance of a JavaScript Error object: napi_throw_error, napi_throw_type_error, napi_throw_range_error and napi_is_error. The following utility functions are also available in case native code needs to create an Error object: napi_create_error, napi_create_type_error, and napi_create_range_error, where result is the napi_value that refers to the newly created JavaScript Error object. The Node.js project is adding error codes to all of the errors generated internally. The goal is for applications to use these error codes for all error checking. The associated error messages will remain, but will only be meant to be used for logging and display with the expectation that the message can change without SemVer applying. In order to support this model with N-API, both in internal functionality and for module specific functionality (as its good practice), the throw_ and create_ functions take an optional code parameter which is the string for the code to be added to the error object. If the optional parameter is NULL then no code will be associated with the error. If a code is provided, the name associated with the error is also updated to be: originalName [code]  where originalName is the original name associated with the error and code is the code that was provided. For example, if the code is 'ERR_ERROR_1' and a TypeError is being created the name will be: TypeError [ERR_ERROR_1]"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_napi_throw","title":"napi_throw","description":"NAPI_EXTERN napi_status napi_throw(napi_env env, napi_value error);   [in] env: The environment that the API is invoked under.

These handles must hold the objects 'live' until they are no longer required by the native code, otherwise the objects could be collected before the native code was finished using them. As object handles are returned they are associated with a 'scope'. The lifespan for the default scope is tied to the lifespan of the native method call. The result is that, by default, handles remain valid and the objects associated with these handles will be held live for the lifespan of the native method call. In many cases, however, it is necessary that the handles remain valid for either a shorter or longer lifespan than that of the native method. The sections which follow describe the N-API functions that can be used to change the handle lifespan from the default."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_making_handle_lifespan_shorter_than_that_of_the_native_method","title":"Making handle lifespan shorter than that of the native method","description":"It is often necessary to make the lifespan of handles shorter than the lifespan of a native method. For example, consider a native method that has a loop which iterates through the elements in a large array: for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {   napi_value result;   napi_status status = napi_get_element(env, object, i, &result);   if (status != napi_ok) {     break;   }   \/\/ do something with element }  This would result in a large number of handles being created, consuming substantial resources. In addition, even though the native code could only use the most recent handle, all of the associated objects would also be kept alive since they all share the same scope. To handle this case, N-API provides the ability to establish a new 'scope' to which newly created handles will be associated. Once those handles are no longer required, the scope can be 'closed' and any handles associated with the scope are invalidated. The methods available to open\/close scopes are napi_open_handle_scope and napi_close_handle_scope. N-API only supports a single nested hierarchy of scopes. There is only one active scope at any time, and all new handles will be associated with that scope while it is active. Scopes must be closed in the reverse order from which they are opened. In addition, all scopes created within a native method must be closed before returning from that method. Taking the earlier example, adding calls to napi_open_handle_scope and napi_close_handle_scope would ensure that at most a single handle is valid throughout the execution of the loop: for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {   napi_handle_scope scope;   napi_status status = napi_open_handle_scope(env, &scope);   if (status != napi_ok) {     break;   }   napi_value result;   status = napi_get_element(env, object, i, &result);   if (status != napi_ok) {     break;   }   \/\/ do something with element   status = napi_close_handle_scope(env, scope);   if (status != napi_ok) {     break;   } }  When nesting scopes, there are cases where a handle from an inner scope needs to live beyond the lifespan of that scope. N-API supports an 'escapable scope' in order to support this case. An escapable scope allows one handle to be 'promoted' so that it 'escapes' the current scope and the lifespan of the handle changes from the current scope to that of the outer scope. The methods available to open\/close escapable scopes are napi_open_escapable_handle_scope and napi_close_escapable_handle_scope.

For example, to create a constructor and later use that constructor in a request to creates instances, it must be possible to reference the constructor object across many different instance creation requests. This would not be possible with a normal handle returned as a napi_value as described in the earlier section. The lifespan of a normal handle is managed by scopes and all scopes must be closed before the end of a native method. N-API provides methods to create persistent references to an object. Each persistent reference has an associated count with a value of 0 or higher. The count determines if the reference will keep the corresponding object live. References with a count of 0 do not prevent the object from being collected and are often called 'weak' references. Any count greater than 0 will prevent the object from being collected. References can be created with an initial reference count. The count can then be modified through napi_reference_ref and napi_reference_unref. If an object is collected while the count for a reference is 0, all subsequent calls to get the object associated with the reference napi_get_reference_value will return NULL for the returned napi_value. An attempt to call napi_reference_ref for a reference whose object has been collected will result in an error. References must be deleted once they are no longer required by the addon. When a reference is deleted it will no longer prevent the corresponding object from being collected. Failure to delete a persistent reference will result in a 'memory leak' with both the native memory for the persistent reference and the corresponding object on the heap being retained forever. There can be multiple persistent references created which refer to the same object, each of which will either keep the object live or not based on its individual count."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_napi_create_reference","title":"napi_create_reference","description":"NAPI_EXTERN napi_status napi_create_reference(napi_env env,                                               napi_value value,                                               uint32_t initial_refcount,                                               napi_ref* result);   [in] env: The environment that the API is invoked under.

For a N-API module it is as follows: napi_value Init(napi_env env, napi_value exports);  The return value from Init is treated as the exports object for the module. The Init method is passed an empty object via the exports parameter as a convenience. If Init returns NULL, the parameter passed as exports is exported by the module. N-API modules cannot modify the module object but can specify anything as the exports property of the module.

It's also safe to use the returned data buffer within the same callback as long as there are no calls to other APIs that might trigger a GC."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_napi_get_buffer_info","title":"napi_get_buffer_info","description":"napi_status napi_get_buffer_info(napi_env env,                                  napi_value value,                                  void** data,                                  size_t* length)   [in] env: The environment that the API is invoked under.

Some of these types are documented under Section 7 of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Properties in JavaScript are represented as a tuple of a key and a value. Fundamentally, all property keys in N-API can be represented in one of the following forms:  Named: a simple UTF8-encoded string Integer-Indexed: an index value represented by uint32_t JavaScript value: these are represented in N-API by napi_value. This can be a napi_value representing a String, Number, or Symbol.  N-API values are represented by the type napi_value. Any N-API call that requires a JavaScript value takes in a napi_value. However, it's the caller's responsibility to make sure that the napi_value in question is of the JavaScript type expected by the API. The APIs documented in this section provide a simple interface to get and set properties on arbitrary JavaScript objects represented by napi_value. For instance, consider the following JavaScript code snippet: const obj = {}; obj.myProp = 123;  The equivalent can be done using N-API values with the following snippet: napi_status status = napi_generic_failure;  \/\/ const obj = {} napi_value obj, value; status = napi_create_object(env, &obj); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ Create a napi_value for 123 status = napi_create_int32(env, 123, &value); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ obj.myProp = 123 status = napi_set_named_property(env, obj, \"myProp\", value); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  Indexed properties can be set in a similar manner. Consider the following JavaScript snippet: const arr = []; arr[123] = 'hello';  The equivalent can be done using N-API values with the following snippet: napi_status status = napi_generic_failure;  \/\/ const arr = []; napi_value arr, value; status = napi_create_array(env, &arr); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ Create a napi_value for 'hello' status = napi_create_string_utf8(env, \"hello\", NAPI_AUTO_LENGTH, &value); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ arr[123] = 'hello'; status = napi_set_element(env, arr, 123, value); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  Properties can be retrieved using the APIs described in this section. Consider the following JavaScript snippet: const arr = []; const value = arr[123];  The following is the approximate equivalent of the N-API counterpart: napi_status status = napi_generic_failure;  \/\/ const arr = [] napi_value arr, value; status = napi_create_array(env, &arr); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ const value = arr[123] status = napi_get_element(env, arr, 123, &value); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  Finally, multiple properties can also be defined on an object for performance reasons. Consider the following JavaScript: const obj = {}; Object.defineProperties(obj, {   'foo': { value: 123, writable: true, configurable: true, enumerable: true },   'bar': { value: 456, writable: true, configurable: true, enumerable: true } });  The following is the approximate equivalent of the N-API counterpart: napi_status status = napi_status_generic_failure;  \/\/ const obj = {}; napi_value obj; status = napi_create_object(env, &obj); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ Create napi_values for 123 and 456 napi_value fooValue, barValue; status = napi_create_int32(env, 123, &fooValue); if (status != napi_ok) return status; status = napi_create_int32(env, 456, &barValue); if (status != napi_ok) return status;  \/\/ Set the properties napi_property_descriptor descriptors[] = {   { \"foo\", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, fooValue, napi_default, NULL },   { \"bar\", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, barValue, napi_default, NULL } } status = napi_define_properties(env,                                 obj,                                 sizeof(descriptors) \/ sizeof(descriptors[0]),                                 descriptors); if (status != napi_ok) return status;"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_structures","title":"Structures","description":""},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_napi_property_attributes","title":"napi_property_attributes","description":"typedef enum {   napi_default = 0,   napi_writable = 1 << 0,   napi_enumerable = 1 << 1,   napi_configurable = 1 << 2,    \/\/ Used with napi_define_class to distinguish static properties   \/\/ from instance properties.

This allows them to schedule work to be executed asynchronously so that their methods can return in advance of the work being completed. This allows them to avoid blocking overall execution of the Node.js application. N-API provides an ABI-stable interface for these supporting functions which covers the most common asynchronous use cases. N-API defines the napi_async_work structure which is used to manage asynchronous workers. Instances are created\/deleted with napi_create_async_work and napi_delete_async_work. The execute and complete callbacks are functions that will be invoked when the executor is ready to execute and when it completes its task respectively. The execute function should avoid making any N-API calls that could result in the execution of JavaScript or interaction with JavaScript objects. Most often, any code that needs to make N-API calls should be made in complete callback instead. Avoid using the napi_env parameter in the execute callback as it will likely execute JavaScript. These functions implement the following interfaces: typedef void (*napi_async_execute_callback)(napi_env env,                                             void* data); typedef void (*napi_async_complete_callback)(napi_env env,                                              napi_status status,                                              void* data);  When these methods are invoked, the data parameter passed will be the addon-provided void* data that was passed into the napi_create_async_work call.

If an addon creates additional threads, then N-API functions that require a napi_env, napi_value, or napi_ref must not be called from those threads. When an addon has additional threads and JavaScript functions need to be invoked based on the processing completed by those threads, those threads must communicate with the addon's main thread so that the main thread can invoke the JavaScript function on their behalf. The thread-safe function APIs provide an easy way to do this. These APIs provide the type napi_threadsafe_function as well as APIs to create, destroy, and call objects of this type. napi_create_threadsafe_function() creates a persistent reference to a napi_value that holds a JavaScript function which can be called from multiple threads. The calls happen asynchronously. This means that values with which the JavaScript callback is to be called will be placed in a queue, and, for each value in the queue, a call will eventually be made to the JavaScript function. Upon creation of a napi_threadsafe_function a napi_finalize callback can be provided. This callback will be invoked on the main thread when the thread-safe function is about to be destroyed. It receives the context and the finalize data given during construction, and provides an opportunity for cleaning up after the threads e.g. by calling uv_thread_join(). Aside from the main loop thread, no threads should be using the thread-safe function after the finalize callback completes. The context given during the call to napi_create_threadsafe_function() can be retrieved from any thread with a call to napi_get_threadsafe_function_context()."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_calling_a_thread_safe_function","title":"Calling a thread-safe function","description":"napi_call_threadsafe_function() can be used for initiating a call into JavaScript. napi_call_threadsafe_function() accepts a parameter which controls whether the API behaves blockingly. If set to napi_tsfn_nonblocking, the API behaves non-blockingly, returning napi_queue_full if the queue was full, preventing data from being successfully added to the queue. If set to napi_tsfn_blocking, the API blocks until space becomes available in the queue. napi_call_threadsafe_function() never blocks if the thread-safe function was created with a maximum queue size of 0. napi_call_threadsafe_function() should not be called with napi_tsfn_blocking from a JavaScript thread, because, if the queue is full, it may cause the JavaScript thread to deadlock. The actual call into JavaScript is controlled by the callback given via the call_js_cb parameter. call_js_cb is invoked on the main thread once for each value that was placed into the queue by a successful call to napi_call_threadsafe_function(). If such a callback is not given, a default callback will be used, and the resulting JavaScript call will have no arguments. The call_js_cb callback receives the JavaScript function to call as a napi_value in its parameters, as well as the void* context pointer used when creating the napi_threadsafe_function, and the next data pointer that was created by one of the secondary threads. The callback can then use an API such as napi_call_function() to call into JavaScript. The callback may also be invoked with env and call_js_cb both set to NULL to indicate that calls into JavaScript are no longer possible, while items remain in the queue that may need to be freed. This normally occurs when the Node.js process exits while there is a thread-safe function still active.

Thus, in addition to specifying an initial number of threads upon creation, napi_acquire_threadsafe_function can be called to indicate that a new thread will start making use of the thread-safe function. Similarly, napi_release_threadsafe_function can be called to indicate that an existing thread will stop making use of the thread-safe function. napi_threadsafe_function objects are destroyed when every thread which uses the object has called napi_release_threadsafe_function() or has received a return status of napi_closing in response to a call to napi_call_threadsafe_function. The queue is emptied before the napi_threadsafe_function is destroyed. napi_release_threadsafe_function() should be the last API call made in conjunction with a given napi_threadsafe_function, because after the call completes, there is no guarantee that the napi_threadsafe_function is still allocated. For the same reason, do not make use of a thread-safe function after receiving a return value of napi_closing in response to a call to napi_call_threadsafe_function. Data associated with the napi_threadsafe_function can be freed in its napi_finalize callback which was passed to napi_create_threadsafe_function(). The parameter initial_thread_count of napi_create_threadsafe_function marks the initial number of aquisitions of the thread-safe functions, instead of calling napi_acquire_threadsafe_function multiple times at creation. Once the number of threads making use of a napi_threadsafe_function reaches zero, no further threads can start making use of it by calling napi_acquire_threadsafe_function(). In fact, all subsequent API calls associated with it, except napi_release_threadsafe_function(), will return an error value of napi_closing. The thread-safe function can be \"aborted\" by giving a value of napi_tsfn_abort to napi_release_threadsafe_function(). This will cause all subsequent APIs associated with the thread-safe function except napi_release_threadsafe_function() to return napi_closing even before its reference count reaches zero. In particular, napi_call_threadsafe_function() will return napi_closing, thus informing the threads that it is no longer possible to make asynchronous calls to the thread-safe function. This can be used as a criterion for terminating the thread.

By default, when Node.js loads a module from a path that is symbolically linked to a different on-disk location, Node.js will dereference the link and use the actual on-disk \"real path\" of the module as both an identifier and as a root path to locate other dependency modules. In most cases, this default behavior is acceptable. However, when using symbolically linked peer dependencies, as illustrated in the example below, the default behavior causes an exception to be thrown if moduleA attempts to require moduleB as a peer dependency: {appDir}  \u251c\u2500\u2500 app  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 node_modules  \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 moduleA -> {appDir}\/moduleA  \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 moduleB  \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js  \u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json  \u2514\u2500\u2500 moduleA      \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js      \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json  The --preserve-symlinks command line flag instructs Node.js to use the symlink path for modules as opposed to the real path, allowing symbolically linked peer dependencies to be found. Note, however, that using --preserve-symlinks can have other side effects. Specifically, symbolically linked native modules can fail to load if those are linked from more than one location in the dependency tree (Node.js would see those as two separate modules and would attempt to load the module multiple times, causing an exception to be thrown). The --preserve-symlinks flag does not apply to the main module, which allows node --preserve-symlinks node_module\/.bin\/<foo> to work.

The \"main\" field is supported in all versions of Node.js, but its capabilities are limited: it only defines the main entry point of the package. The \"exports\" field provides an alternative to \"main\" where the package main entry point can be defined while also encapsulating the package, preventing any other entry points besides those defined in \"exports\". This encapsulation allows module authors to define a public interface for their package. If both \"exports\" and \"main\" are defined, the \"exports\" field takes precedence over \"main\". \"exports\" are not specific to ES modules or CommonJS; \"main\" will be overridden by \"exports\" if it exists. As such \"main\" cannot be used as a fallback for CommonJS but it can be used as a fallback for legacy versions of Node.js that do not support the \"exports\" field. Conditional Exports can be used within \"exports\" to define different package entry points per environment, including whether the package is referenced via require or via import. For more information about supporting both CommonJS and ES Modules in a single package please consult the dual CommonJS\/ES module packages section. Warning: Introducing the \"exports\" field prevents consumers of a package from using any entry points that are not defined, including the package.json (e.g. require('your-package\/package.json'). This will likely be a breaking change. To make the introduction of \"exports\" non-breaking, ensure that every previously supported entry point is exported. It is best to explicitly specify entry points so that the package\u2019s public API is well-defined. For example, a project that previous exported main, lib, feature, and the package.json could use the following package.exports: {   \"name\": \"my-mod\",   \"exports\": {     \".\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/lib\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/lib\/index\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/lib\/index.js\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/feature\": \".\/feature\/index.js\",     \".\/feature\/index.js\": \".\/feature\/index.js\",     \".\/package.json\": \".\/package.json\"   } }  Alternatively a project could choose to export entire folders: {   \"name\": \"my-mod\",   \"exports\": {     \".\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/lib\": \".\/lib\/index.js\",     \".\/lib\/\": \".\/lib\/\",     \".\/feature\": \".\/feature\/index.js\",     \".\/feature\/\": \".\/feature\/\",     \".\/package.json\": \".\/package.json\"   } }  As a last resort, package encapsulation can be disabled entirely by creating an export for the root of the package \".\/\": \".\/\". This will expose every file in the package at the cost of disabling the encapsulation and potential tooling benefits this provides. As the ES Module loader in Node.js enforces the use of the full specifier path, exporting the root rather than being explicit about entry is less expressive than either of the prior examples. Not only will encapsulation be lost but module consumers will be unable to import feature from 'my-mod\/feature' as they will need to provide the full path import feature from 'my-mod\/feature\/index.js."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_main_entry_point_export","title":"Main Entry Point Export","description":"To set the main entry point for a package, it is advisable to define both \"exports\" and \"main\" in the package\u2019s package.json file:  {   \"main\": \".\/main.js\",   \"exports\": \".\/main.js\" }  The benefit of doing this is that when using the \"exports\" field all subpaths of the package will no longer be available to importers under require('pkg\/subpath.js'), and instead they will get a new error, ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. This encapsulation of exports provides more reliable guarantees about package interfaces for tools and when handling semver upgrades for a package.

Can reference either an ES module or CommonJS file, as both import and import() can load either ES module or CommonJS sources. \"require\" - matched when the package is loaded via require(). As require() only supports CommonJS, the referenced file must be CommonJS. \"node\" - matched for any Node.js environment. Can be a CommonJS or ES module file. This condition should always come after \"import\" or \"require\". \"default\" - the generic fallback that will always match. Can be a CommonJS or ES module file. This condition should always come last.  Condition matching is applied in object order from first to last within the \"exports\" object. The general rule is that conditions should be used from most specific to least specific in object order.

Further restrictions, definitions or guidance on condition names may be provided in the future. Using the \"import\" and \"require\" conditions can lead to some hazards, which are explained further in the dual CommonJS\/ES module packages section.

This enabled Node.js to run the CommonJS entry point while build tools such as bundlers used the ES module entry point, since Node.js ignored (and still ignores) the top-level \"module\" field. Node.js can now run ES module entry points, and a package can contain both CommonJS and ES module entry points (either via separate specifiers such as 'pkg' and 'pkg\/es-module', or both at the same specifier via Conditional Exports). Unlike in the scenario where \"module\" is only used by bundlers, or ES module files are transpiled into CommonJS on the fly before evaluation by Node.js, the files referenced by the ES module entry point are evaluated as ES modules."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_dual_package_hazard","title":"Dual Package Hazard","description":"When an application is using a package that provides both CommonJS and ES module sources, there is a risk of certain bugs if both versions of the package get loaded. This potential comes from the fact that the pkgInstance created by const pkgInstance = require('pkg') is not the same as the pkgInstance created by import pkgInstance from 'pkg' (or an alternative main path like 'pkg\/module'). This is the \u201cdual package hazard,\u201d where two versions of the same package can be loaded within the same runtime environment. While it is unlikely that an application or package would intentionally load both versions directly, it is common for an application to load one version while a dependency of the application loads the other version. This hazard can happen because Node.js supports intermixing CommonJS and ES modules, and can lead to unexpected behavior. If the package main export is a constructor, an instanceof comparison of instances created by the two versions returns false, and if the export is an object, properties added to one (like pkgInstance.foo = 3) are not present on the other. This differs from how import and require statements work in all-CommonJS or all-ES module environments, respectively, and therefore is surprising to users. It also differs from the behavior users are familiar with when using transpilation via tools like Babel or esm."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_writing_dual_packages_while_avoiding_or_minimizing_hazards","title":"Writing Dual Packages While Avoiding or Minimizing Hazards","description":"First, the hazard described in the previous section occurs when a package contains both CommonJS and ES module sources and both sources are provided for use in Node.js, either via separate main entry points or exported paths. A package could instead be written where any version of Node.js receives only CommonJS sources, and any separate ES module sources the package may contain could be intended only for other environments such as browsers. Such a package would be usable by any version of Node.js, since import can refer to CommonJS files; but it would not provide any of the advantages of using ES module syntax. A package could also switch from CommonJS to ES module syntax in a breaking change version bump. This has the disadvantage that the newest version of the package would only be usable in ES module-supporting versions of Node.js. Every pattern has tradeoffs, but there are two broad approaches that satisfy the following conditions:  The package is usable via both require and import. The package is usable in both current Node.js and older versions of Node.js that lack support for ES modules. The package main entry point, e.g. 'pkg' can be used by both require to resolve to a CommonJS file and by import to resolve to an ES module file. (And likewise for exported paths, e.g. 'pkg\/feature'.) The package provides named exports, e.g. import { name } from 'pkg' rather than import pkg from 'pkg'; pkg.name. The package is potentially usable in other ES module environments such as browsers. The hazards described in the previous section are avoided or minimized."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_approach_1_use_an_es_module_wrapper","title":"Approach #1: Use an ES Module Wrapper","description":"Write the package in CommonJS or transpile ES module sources into CommonJS, and create an ES module wrapper file that defines the named exports. Using Conditional Exports, the ES module wrapper is used for import and the CommonJS entry point for require.  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/package.json {   \"type\": \"module\",   \"main\": \".\/index.cjs\",   \"exports\": {     \"import\": \".\/wrapper.mjs\",     \"require\": \".\/index.cjs\"   } }  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/index.cjs exports.name = 'value';  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/wrapper.mjs import cjsModule from '.\/index.cjs'; export const name = cjsModule.name;  In this example, the name from import { name } from 'pkg' is the same singleton as the name from const { name } = require('pkg'). Therefore === returns true when comparing the two names and the divergent specifier hazard is avoided. If the module is not simply a list of named exports, but rather contains a unique function or object export like module.exports = function () { ... }, or if support in the wrapper for the import pkg from 'pkg' pattern is desired, then the wrapper would instead be written to export the default optionally along with any named exports as well: import cjsModule from '.\/index.cjs'; export const name = cjsModule.name; export default cjsModule;  This approach is appropriate for any of the following use cases:  The package is currently written in CommonJS and the author would prefer not to refactor it into ES module syntax, but wishes to provide named exports for ES module consumers. The package has other packages that depend on it, and the end user might install both this package and those other packages. For example a utilities package is used directly in an application, and a utilities-plus package adds a few more functions to utilities. Because the wrapper exports underlying CommonJS files, it doesn\u2019t matter if utilities-plus is written in CommonJS or ES module syntax; it will work either way. The package stores internal state, and the package author would prefer not to refactor the package to isolate its state management. See the next section.  A variant of this approach not requiring conditional exports for consumers could be to add an export, e.g. \".\/module\", to point to an all-ES module-syntax version of the package. This could be used via import 'pkg\/module' by users who are certain that the CommonJS version will not be loaded anywhere in the application, such as by dependencies; or if the CommonJS version can be loaded but doesn\u2019t affect the ES module version (for example, because the package is stateless):  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/package.json {   \"type\": \"module\",   \"main\": \".\/index.cjs\",   \"exports\": {     \".\": \".\/index.cjs\",     \".\/module\": \".\/wrapper.mjs\"   } }"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_approach_2_isolate_state","title":"Approach #2: Isolate State","description":"A package.json file can define the separate CommonJS and ES module entry points directly:  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/package.json {   \"type\": \"module\",   \"main\": \".\/index.cjs\",   \"exports\": {     \"import\": \".\/index.mjs\",     \"require\": \".\/index.cjs\"   } }  This can be done if both the CommonJS and ES module versions of the package are equivalent, for example because one is the transpiled output of the other; and the package\u2019s management of state is carefully isolated (or the package is stateless). The reason that state is an issue is because both the CommonJS and ES module versions of the package may get used within an application; for example, the user\u2019s application code could import the ES module version while a dependency requires the CommonJS version. If that were to occur, two copies of the package would be loaded in memory and therefore two separate states would be present. This would likely cause hard-to-troubleshoot bugs. Aside from writing a stateless package (if JavaScript\u2019s Math were a package, for example, it would be stateless as all of its methods are static), there are some ways to isolate state so that it\u2019s shared between the potentially loaded CommonJS and ES module instances of the package:   If possible, contain all state within an instantiated object. JavaScript\u2019s Date, for example, needs to be instantiated to contain state; if it were a package, it would be used like this: import Date from 'date'; const someDate = new Date(); \/\/ someDate contains state; Date does not  The new keyword isn\u2019t required; a package\u2019s function can return a new object, or modify a passed-in object, to keep the state external to the package.   Isolate the state in one or more CommonJS files that are shared between the CommonJS and ES module versions of the package. For example, if the CommonJS and ES module entry points are index.cjs and index.mjs, respectively: \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/index.cjs const state = require('.\/state.cjs'); module.exports.state = state;  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/index.mjs import state from '.\/state.cjs'; export {   state };  Even if pkg is used via both require and import in an application (for example, via import in application code and via require by a dependency) each reference of pkg will contain the same state; and modifying that state from either module system will apply to both.   Any plugins that attach to the package\u2019s singleton would need to separately attach to both the CommonJS and ES module singletons. This approach is appropriate for any of the following use cases:  The package is currently written in ES module syntax and the package author wants that version to be used wherever such syntax is supported. The package is stateless or its state can be isolated without too much difficulty. The package is unlikely to have other public packages that depend on it, or if it does, the package is stateless or has state that need not be shared between dependencies or with the overall application.  Even with isolated state, there is still the cost of possible extra code execution between the CommonJS and ES module versions of a package. As with the previous approach, a variant of this approach not requiring conditional exports for consumers could be to add an export, e.g. \".\/module\", to point to an all-ES module-syntax version of the package:  \/\/ .\/node_modules\/pkg\/package.json {   \"type\": \"module\",   \"main\": \".\/index.cjs\",   \"exports\": {     \".\": \".\/index.cjs\",     \".\/module\": \".\/index.mjs\"   } }"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_import_specifiers","title":"`import` Specifiers","description":""},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_terminology","title":"Terminology","description":"The specifier of an import statement is the string after the from keyword, e.g. 'path' in import { sep } from 'path'.

How these errors are reported and handled depends entirely on the type of Error and the style of the API that is called. All JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that immediately generate and throw an error using the standard JavaScript throw mechanism. These are handled using the try\u2026catch construct provided by the JavaScript language. \/\/ Throws with a ReferenceError because z is not defined. try {   const m = 1;   const n = m + z; } catch (err) {   \/\/ Handle the error here. }  Any use of the JavaScript throw mechanism will raise an exception that must be handled using try\u2026catch or the Node.js process will exit immediately. With few exceptions, Synchronous APIs (any blocking method that does not accept a callback function, such as fs.readFileSync), will use throw to report errors. Errors that occur within Asynchronous APIs may be reported in multiple ways:  Most asynchronous methods that accept a callback function will accept an Error object passed as the first argument to that function. If that first argument is not null and is an instance of Error, then an error occurred that should be handled.   const fs = require('fs'); fs.readFile('a file that does not exist', (err, data) => {   if (err) {     console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);     return;   }   \/\/ Otherwise handle the data });    When an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an EventEmitter, errors can be routed to that object's 'error' event. const net = require('net'); const connection = net.connect('localhost');  \/\/ Adding an 'error' event handler to a stream: connection.on('error', (err) => {   \/\/ If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can't   \/\/ connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by   \/\/ the connection, the error will be sent here.   console.error(err); });  connection.pipe(process.stdout);    A handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still use the throw mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using try\u2026catch. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please refer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate error handling mechanism required.   The use of the 'error' event mechanism is most common for stream-based and event emitter-based APIs, which themselves represent a series of asynchronous operations over time (as opposed to a single operation that may pass or fail). For all EventEmitter objects, if an 'error' event handler is not provided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an uncaught exception and crash unless either: The domain module is used appropriately or a handler has been registered for the 'uncaughtException' event. const EventEmitter = require('events'); const ee = new EventEmitter();  setImmediate(() => {   \/\/ This will crash the process because no 'error' event   \/\/ handler has been added.   ee.emit('error', new Error('This will crash')); });  Errors generated in this way cannot be intercepted using try\u2026catch as they are thrown after the calling code has already exited.

With this pattern, a callback function is passed to the method as an argument. When the operation either completes or an error is raised, the callback function is called with the Error object (if any) passed as the first argument.

By the time the callback has been called, the surrounding code, including the try\u2026catch block, will have already exited.

When using require() all resources involved in loading are checked for integrity if a policy manifest has been specified. If a resource does not match the integrity listed in the manifest, an error will be thrown. An example policy file that would allow loading a file checked.js: {   \"resources\": {     \".\/app\/checked.js\": {       \"integrity\": \"sha384-SggXRQHwCG8g+DktYYzxkXRIkTiEYWBHqev0xnpCxYlqMBufKZHAHQM3\/boDaI\/0\"     }   } }  Each resource listed in the policy manifest can be of one the following formats to determine its location:  A relative url string to a resource from the manifest such as .\/resource.js, ..\/resource.js, or \/resource.js. A complete url string to a resource such as file:\/\/\/resource.js.  When loading resources the entire URL must match including search parameters and hash fragment. .\/a.js?b will not be used when attempting to load .\/a.js and vice versa. To generate integrity strings, a script such as printf \"sha384-$(cat checked.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | base64)\" can be used. Integrity can be specified as the boolean value true to accept any body for the resource which can be useful for local development. It is not recommended in production since it would allow unexpected alteration of resources to be considered valid."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_dependency_redirection","title":"Dependency Redirection","description":"An application may need to ship patched versions of modules or to prevent modules from allowing all modules access to all other modules. Redirection can be used by intercepting attempts to load the modules wishing to be replaced. {   \"builtins\": [],   \"resources\": {     \".\/app\/checked.js\": {       \"dependencies\": {         \"fs\": true,         \"os\": \".\/app\/node_modules\/alt-os\"       }     }   } }  The dependencies are keyed by the requested string specifier and have values of either true or a string pointing to a module that will be resolved. The specifier string does not perform any searching and must match exactly what is provided to the require(). Therefore, multiple specifiers may be needed in the policy if require() uses multiple different strings to point to the same module (such as excluding the extension). If the value of the redirection is true the default searching algorithms will be used to find the module. If the value of the redirection is a string, it will be resolved relative to the manifest and then immediately be used without searching. Any specifier string that is require()ed and not listed in the dependencies will result in an error according to the policy. Redirection will not prevent access to APIs through means such as direct access to require.cache and\/or through module.constructor which allow access to loading modules. Policy redirection only affect specifiers to require(). Other means such as to prevent undesired access to APIs through variables are necessary to lock down that path of loading modules. A boolean value of true for the dependencies map can be specified to allow a module to load any specifier without redirection. This can be useful for local development and may have some valid usage in production, but should be used only with care after auditing a module to ensure its behavior is valid. Example: Patched Dependency Redirected dependencies can provide attenuated or modified functionality as fits the application. For example, log data about timing of function durations by wrapping the original: const original = require('fn'); module.exports = function fn(...args) {   console.time();   try {     return new.target ?       Reflect.construct(original, args) :       Reflect.apply(original, this, args);   } finally {     console.timeEnd();   } };"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_diagnostic_report","title":"Diagnostic Report","description":"Delivers a JSON-formatted diagnostic summary, written to a file.

--report-on-fatalerror app.js    --report-uncaught-exception Enables report to be generated on un-caught exceptions. Useful when inspecting JavaScript stack in conjunction with native stack and other runtime environment data.   --report-on-signal Enables report to be generated upon receiving the specified (or predefined) signal to the running Node.js process. (See below on how to modify the signal that triggers the report.) Default signal is SIGUSR2. Useful when a report needs to be triggered from another program. Application monitors may leverage this feature to collect report at regular intervals and plot rich set of internal runtime data to their views.   Signal based report generation is not supported in Windows. Under normal circumstances, there is no need to modify the report triggering signal. However, if SIGUSR2 is already used for other purposes, then this flag helps to change the signal for report generation and preserve the original meaning of SIGUSR2 for the said purposes.   --report-on-fatalerror Enables the report to be triggered on fatal errors (internal errors within the Node.js runtime, such as out of memory) that leads to termination of the application. Useful to inspect various diagnostic data elements such as heap, stack, event loop state, resource consumption etc. to reason about the fatal error.   --report-compact Write reports in a compact format, single-line JSON, more easily consumable by log processing systems than the default multi-line format designed for human consumption.   --report-directory Location at which the report will be generated.   --report-filename Name of the file to which the report will be written.   --report-signal Sets or resets the signal for report generation (not supported on Windows). Default signal is SIGUSR2.   A report can also be triggered via an API call from a JavaScript application: process.report.writeReport();  This function takes an optional additional argument filename, which is the name of a file into which the report is written. process.report.writeReport('.\/foo.json');  This function takes an optional additional argument err which is an Error object that will be used as the context for the JavaScript stack printed in the report. When using report to handle errors in a callback or an exception handler, this allows the report to include the location of the original error as well as where it was handled. try {   process.chdir('\/non-existent-path'); } catch (err) {   process.report.writeReport(err); } \/\/ Any other code  If both filename and error object are passed to writeReport() the error object must be the second parameter. try {   process.chdir('\/non-existent-path'); } catch (err) {   process.report.writeReport(filename, err); } \/\/ Any other code  The content of the diagnostic report can be returned as a JavaScript Object via an API call from a JavaScript application: const report = process.report.getReport(); console.log(typeof report === 'object'); \/\/ true  \/\/ Similar to process.report.writeReport() output console.log(JSON.stringify(report, null, 2));  This function takes an optional additional argument err, which is an Error object that will be used as the context for the JavaScript stack printed in the report. const report = process.report.getReport(new Error('custom error')); console.log(typeof report === 'object'); \/\/ true  The API versions are useful when inspecting the runtime state from within the application, in expectation of self-adjusting the resource consumption, load balancing, monitoring etc. The content of the report consists of a header section containing the event type, date, time, PID and Node.js version, sections containing JavaScript and native stack traces, a section containing V8 heap information, a section containing libuv handle information and an OS platform information section showing CPU and memory usage and system limits. An example report can be triggered using the Node.js REPL: $ node > process.report.writeReport(); Writing Node.js report to file: report.20181126.091102.8480.0.001.json Node.js report completed >  When a report is written, start and end messages are issued to stderr and the filename of the report is returned to the caller.

Many web pages and other document formats use UTF-8. This is the default character encoding. When decoding a Buffer into a string that does not exclusively contain valid UTF-8 data, the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD \ufffd will be used to represent those errors.   'utf16le': Multi-byte encoded Unicode characters. Unlike 'utf8', each character in the string will be encoded using either 2 or 4 bytes. Node.js only supports the little-endian variant of UTF-16.   'latin1': Latin-1 stands for ISO-8859-1. This character encoding only supports the Unicode characters from U+0000 to U+00FF. Each character is encoded using a single byte. Characters that do not fit into that range are truncated and will be mapped to characters in that range.   Converting a Buffer into a string using one of the above is referred to as decoding, and converting a string into a Buffer is referred to as encoding. Node.js also supports the following two binary-to-text encodings. For binary-to-text encodings, the naming convention is reversed: Converting a Buffer into a string is typically referred to as encoding, and converting a string into a Buffer as decoding.   'base64': Base64 encoding. When creating a Buffer from a string, this encoding will also correctly accept \"URL and Filename Safe Alphabet\" as specified in RFC 4648, Section 5.   'hex': Encode each byte as two hexadecimal characters. Data truncation may occur when decoding string that do exclusively contain valid hexadecimal characters. See below for an example.   The following legacy character encodings are also supported:   'ascii': For 7-bit ASCII data only. When encoding a string into a Buffer, this is equivalent to using 'latin1'. When decoding a Buffer into a string, using encoding this will additionally unset the highest bit of each byte before decoding as 'latin1'. Generally, there should be no reason to use this encoding, as 'utf8' (or, if the data is known to always be ASCII-only, 'latin1') will be a better choice when encoding or decoding ASCII-only text. It is only provided for legacy compatibility.   'binary': Alias for 'latin1'. See binary strings for more background on this topic. The name of this encoding can be very misleading, as all of the encodings listed here convert between strings and binary data. For converting between strings and Buffers, typically 'utf-8' is the right choice.   'ucs2': Alias of 'utf16le'. UCS-2 used to refer to a variant of UTF-16 that did not support characters that had code points larger than U+FFFF. In Node.js, these code points are always supported.   Buffer.from('1ag', 'hex'); \/\/ Prints <Buffer 1a>, data truncated when first non-hexadecimal value \/\/ ('g') encountered.

Uint8Array in turn is a subclass of TypedArray. Therefore, all TypedArray methods are also available on Buffers. However, there are subtle incompatibilities between the Buffer API and the TypedArray API. In particular:  While TypedArray#slice() creates a copy of part of the TypedArray, Buffer#slice() creates a view over the existing Buffer without copying. This behavior can be surprising, and only exists for legacy compatibility. TypedArray#subarray() can be used to achieve the behavior of Buffer#slice() on both Buffers and other TypedArrays. buf.toString() is incompatible with its TypedArray equivalent. A number of methods, e.g. buf.indexOf(), support additional arguments.  There are two ways to create new TypedArray instances from a Buffer. When passing a Buffer to a TypedArray constructor, the Buffer\u2019s elements will be copied, interpreted as an array of integers, and not as a byte array of the target type.

In order to create a TypedArray that shares its memory with the Buffer, the underlying ArrayBuffer can be passed to the TypedArray constructor instead: const buf = Buffer.from('hello', 'utf16le'); const uint16arr = new Uint16Array(   buf.buffer, buf.byteOffset, buf.length \/ Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);  It is also possible to create a new Buffer that shares the same allocated memory as a TypedArray instance by using the TypedArray object\u2019s .buffer property in the same way.

Prior to Node.js 8.0.0, the memory allocated for such Buffer instances is not initialized and can contain sensitive data. Such Buffer instances must be subsequently initialized by using either buf.fill(0) or by writing to the entire Buffer before reading data from the Buffer. While this behavior is intentional to improve performance, development experience has demonstrated that a more explicit distinction is required between creating a fast-but-uninitialized Buffer versus creating a slower-but-safer Buffer. Since Node.js 8.0.0, Buffer(num) and new Buffer(num) return a Buffer with initialized memory. Passing a string, array, or Buffer as the first argument copies the passed object's data into the Buffer. Passing an ArrayBuffer or a SharedArrayBuffer returns a Buffer that shares allocated memory with the given array buffer.  Because the behavior of new Buffer() is different depending on the type of the first argument, security and reliability issues can be inadvertently introduced into applications when argument validation or Buffer initialization is not performed. For example, if an attacker can cause an application to receive a number where a string is expected, the application may call new Buffer(100) instead of new Buffer(\"100\"), leading it to allocate a 100 byte buffer instead of allocating a 3 byte buffer with content \"100\". This is commonly possible using JSON API calls. Since JSON distinguishes between numeric and string types, it allows injection of numbers where a naively written application that does not validate its input sufficiently might expect to always receive a string. Before Node.js 8.0.0, the 100 byte buffer might contain arbitrary pre-existing in-memory data, so may be used to expose in-memory secrets to a remote attacker. Since Node.js 8.0.0, exposure of memory cannot occur because the data is zero-filled. However, other attacks are still possible, such as causing very large buffers to be allocated by the server, leading to performance degradation or crashing on memory exhaustion. To make the creation of Buffer instances more reliable and less error-prone, the various forms of the new Buffer() constructor have been deprecated and replaced by separate Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), and Buffer.allocUnsafe() methods. Developers should migrate all existing uses of the new Buffer() constructors to one of these new APIs.  Buffer.from(array) returns a new Buffer that contains a copy of the provided octets. Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]]) returns a new Buffer that shares the same allocated memory as the given ArrayBuffer. Buffer.from(buffer) returns a new Buffer that contains a copy of the contents of the given Buffer. Buffer.from(string[, encoding]) returns a new Buffer that contains a copy of the provided string. Buffer.alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]]) returns a new initialized Buffer of the specified size. This method is slower than Buffer.allocUnsafe(size) but guarantees that newly created Buffer instances never contain old data that is potentially sensitive. A TypeError will be thrown if size is not a number. Buffer.allocUnsafe(size) and Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size) each return a new uninitialized Buffer of the specified size. Because the Buffer is uninitialized, the allocated segment of memory might contain old data that is potentially sensitive.

These pipes have limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the child process writes to stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the child process will block waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the { stdio: 'ignore' } option if the output will not be consumed.

The cluster module supports two methods of distributing incoming connections. The first one (and the default one on all platforms except Windows), is the round-robin approach, where the master process listens on a port, accepts new connections and distributes them across the workers in a round-robin fashion, with some built-in smarts to avoid overloading a worker process. The second approach is where the master process creates the listen socket and sends it to interested workers. The workers then accept incoming connections directly. The second approach should, in theory, give the best performance. In practice however, distribution tends to be very unbalanced due to operating system scheduler vagaries. Loads have been observed where over 70% of all connections ended up in just two processes, out of a total of eight. Because server.listen() hands off most of the work to the master process, there are three cases where the behavior between a normal Node.js process and a cluster worker differs:  server.listen({fd: 7}) Because the message is passed to the master, file descriptor 7 in the parent will be listened on, and the handle passed to the worker, rather than listening to the worker's idea of what the number 7 file descriptor references. server.listen(handle) Listening on handles explicitly will cause the worker to use the supplied handle, rather than talk to the master process. server.listen(0) Normally, this will cause servers to listen on a random port. However, in a cluster, each worker will receive the same \"random\" port each time they do listen(0). In essence, the port is random the first time, but predictable thereafter. To listen on a unique port, generate a port number based on the cluster worker ID.  Node.js does not provide routing logic. It is, therefore important to design an application such that it does not rely too heavily on in-memory data objects for things like sessions and login. Because workers are all separate processes, they can be killed or re-spawned depending on a program's needs, without affecting other workers. As long as there are some workers still alive, the server will continue to accept connections. If no workers are alive, existing connections will be dropped and new connections will be refused. Node.js does not automatically manage the number of workers, however. It is the application's responsibility to manage the worker pool based on its own needs. Although a primary use case for the cluster module is networking, it can also be used for other use cases requiring worker processes."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_console","title":"Console","description":"The console module provides a simple debugging console that is similar to the JavaScript console mechanism provided by web browsers.

The better approach is to send an error response to the request that triggered the error, while letting the others finish in their normal time, and stop listening for new requests in that worker. In this way, domain usage goes hand-in-hand with the cluster module, since the master process can fork a new worker when a worker encounters an error.

So the following is prone to error because the fs.stat() operation may complete before the fs.rename() operation: fs.rename('\/tmp\/hello', '\/tmp\/world', (err) => {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('renamed complete'); }); fs.stat('\/tmp\/world', (err, stats) => {   if (err) throw err;   console.log(`stats: ${JSON.stringify(stats)}`); });  To correctly order the operations, move the fs.stat() call into the callback of the fs.rename() operation: fs.rename('\/tmp\/hello', '\/tmp\/world', (err) => {   if (err) throw err;   fs.stat('\/tmp\/world', (err, stats) => {     if (err) throw err;     console.log(`stats: ${JSON.stringify(stats)}`);   }); });  In busy processes, use the asynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions will block the entire process until they complete, halting all connections. While it is not recommended, most fs functions allow the callback argument to be omitted, in which case a default callback is used that rethrows errors. To get a trace to the original call site, set the NODE_DEBUG environment variable: Omitting the callback function on asynchronous fs functions is deprecated and may result in an error being thrown in the future. $ cat script.js function bad() {   require('fs').readFile('\/'); } bad();  $ env NODE_DEBUG=fs node script.js fs.js:88         throw backtrace;         ^ Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read     <stack trace.>"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_fs_access_path_mode_callback","title":"`fs.access(path[, mode], callback)`","description":"Tests a user's permissions for the file or directory specified by path.

The implications of this are a common source of confusion. In the file descriptor case, the file is not replaced! The data is not necessarily written to the beginning of the file, and the file's original data may remain before and\/or after the newly written data. For example, if fs.writeFile() is called twice in a row, first to write the string 'Hello', then to write the string ', World', the file would contain 'Hello, World', and might contain some of the file's original data (depending on the size of the original file, and the position of the file descriptor).

On such systems, it is possible for a single file path to contain sub-sequences that use multiple character encodings. As with string paths, Buffer paths may be relative or absolute: Example using an absolute path on POSIX: fs.open(Buffer.from('\/open\/some\/file.txt'), 'r', (err, fd) => {   if (err) throw err;   fs.close(fd, (err) => {     if (err) throw err;   }); });  On Windows, Node.js follows the concept of per-drive working directory.

'a': Open file for appending. The file is created if it does not exist.   'ax': Like 'a' but fails if the path exists.   'a+': Open file for reading and appending. The file is created if it does not exist.   'ax+': Like 'a+' but fails if the path exists.   'as': Open file for appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.   'as+': Open file for reading and appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.   'r': Open file for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.   'r+': Open file for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.   'rs+': Open file for reading and writing in synchronous mode. Instructs the operating system to bypass the local file system cache. This is primarily useful for opening files on NFS mounts as it allows skipping the potentially stale local cache. It has a very real impact on I\/O performance so using this flag is not recommended unless it is needed. This doesn't turn fs.open() or fsPromises.open() into a synchronous blocking call. If synchronous operation is desired, something like fs.openSync() should be used.   'w': Open file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).   'wx': Like 'w' but fails if the path exists.   'w+': Open file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).   'wx+': Like 'w+' but fails if the path exists.   flag can also be a number as documented by open(2); commonly used constants are available from fs.constants. On Windows, flags are translated to their equivalent ones where applicable, e.g. O_WRONLY to FILE_GENERIC_WRITE, or O_EXCL|O_CREAT to CREATE_NEW, as accepted by CreateFileW. The exclusive flag 'x' (O_EXCL flag in open(2)) ensures that path is newly created. On POSIX systems, path is considered to exist even if it is a symlink to a non-existent file. The exclusive flag may or may not work with network file systems. On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode. The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to the end of the file. Modifying a file rather than replacing it may require the flag option to be set to 'r+' rather than the default 'w'. The behavior of some flags are platform-specific. As such, opening a directory on macOS and Linux with the 'a+' flag, as in the example below, will return an error. In contrast, on Windows and FreeBSD, a file descriptor or a FileHandle will be returned. \/\/ macOS and Linux fs.open('<directory>', 'a+', (err, fd) => {   \/\/ => [Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, open <directory>] });  \/\/ Windows and FreeBSD fs.open('<directory>', 'a+', (err, fd) => {   \/\/ => null, <fd> });  On Windows, opening an existing hidden file using the 'w' flag (either through fs.open() or fs.writeFile() or fsPromises.open()) will fail with EPERM. Existing hidden files can be opened for writing with the 'r+' flag. A call to fs.ftruncate() or filehandle.truncate() can be used to reset the file contents."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_http","title":"HTTP","description":"To use the HTTP server and client one must require('http'). The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the user is able to stream data. HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:  { 'content-length': '123',   'content-type': 'text\/plain',   'connection': 'keep-alive',   'host': 'mysite.com',   'accept': '*\/*' }  Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified. In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not parse the actual headers or the body. See message.headers for details on how duplicate headers are handled. The raw headers as they were received are retained in the rawHeaders property, which is an array of [key, value, key2, value2, ...]. For example, the previous message header object might have a rawHeaders list like the following:  [ 'ConTent-Length', '123456',   'content-LENGTH', '123',   'content-type', 'text\/plain',   'CONNECTION', 'keep-alive',   'Host', 'mysite.com',   'accepT', '*\/*' ]"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_http_createserver_options_requestlistener","title":"`http.createServer([options][, requestListener])`","description":"Returns a new instance of http.Server.

Package manager programs such as dpkg, rpm, and npm will hopefully find it possible to build native packages from Node.js modules without modification. Below we give a suggested directory structure that could work: Let's say that we wanted to have the folder at \/usr\/lib\/node\/<some-package>\/<some-version> hold the contents of a specific version of a package. Packages can depend on one another. In order to install package foo, it may be necessary to install a specific version of package bar. The bar package may itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these may even collide or form cyclic dependencies. Since Node.js looks up the realpath of any modules it loads (that is, resolves symlinks), and then looks for their dependencies in the node_modules folders as described here, this situation is very simple to resolve with the following architecture:  \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/: Contents of the foo package, version 1.2.3. \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/: Contents of the bar package that foo depends on. \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/node_modules\/bar: Symbolic link to \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/. \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/node_modules\/*: Symbolic links to the packages that bar depends on.  Thus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency conflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency that it can use. When the code in the foo package does require('bar'), it will get the version that is symlinked into \/usr\/lib\/node\/foo\/1.2.3\/node_modules\/bar. Then, when the code in the bar package calls require('quux'), it'll get the version that is symlinked into \/usr\/lib\/node\/bar\/4.3.2\/node_modules\/quux. Furthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather than putting packages directly in \/usr\/lib\/node, we could put them in \/usr\/lib\/node_modules\/<name>\/<version>. Then Node.js will not bother looking for missing dependencies in \/usr\/node_modules or \/node_modules. In order to make modules available to the Node.js REPL, it might be useful to also add the \/usr\/lib\/node_modules folder to the $NODE_PATH environment variable. Since the module lookups using node_modules folders are all relative, and based on the real path of the files making the calls to require(), the packages themselves can be anywhere."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_all_together","title":"All Together...","description":"To get the exact filename that will be loaded when require() is called, use the require.resolve() function.

An example package.json file might look like this: { \"name\" : \"some-library\",   \"main\" : \".\/lib\/some-library.js\" }  If this was in a folder at .\/some-library, then require('.\/some-library') would attempt to load .\/some-library\/lib\/some-library.js. This is the extent of the awareness of package.json files within Node.js. If there is no package.json file present in the directory, or if the 'main' entry is missing or cannot be resolved, then Node.js will attempt to load an index.js or index.node file out of that directory. For example, if there was no package.json file in the above example, then require('.\/some-library') would attempt to load:  .\/some-library\/index.js .\/some-library\/index.node  If these attempts fail, then Node.js will report the entire module as missing with the default error: Error: Cannot find module 'some-library'"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_loading_from_node_modules_folders","title":"Loading from `node_modules` Folders","description":"If the module identifier passed to require() is not a core module, and does not begin with '\/', '..\/', or '.\/', then Node.js starts at the parent directory of the current module, and adds \/node_modules, and attempts to load the module from that location.

If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so on, until the root of the file system is reached.

NODE_PATH is still supported, but is less necessary now that the Node.js ecosystem has settled on a convention for locating dependent modules. Sometimes deployments that rely on NODE_PATH show surprising behavior when people are unaware that NODE_PATH must be set. Sometimes a module's dependencies change, causing a different version (or even a different module) to be loaded as the NODE_PATH is searched. Additionally, Node.js will search in the following list of GLOBAL_FOLDERS:  1: $HOME\/.node_modules 2: $HOME\/.node_libraries 3: $PREFIX\/lib\/node  Where $HOME is the user's home directory, and $PREFIX is the Node.js configured node_prefix.

On Unix, the local domain is also known as the Unix domain. The path is a filesystem pathname. It gets truncated to an OS-dependent length of sizeof(sockaddr_un.sun_path) - 1. Typical values are 107 bytes on Linux and 103 bytes on macOS. If a Node.js API abstraction creates the Unix domain socket, it will unlink the Unix domain socket as well. For example, net.createServer() may create a Unix domain socket and server.close() will unlink it. But if a user creates the Unix domain socket outside of these abstractions, the user will need to remove it. The same applies when a Node.js API creates a Unix domain socket but the program then crashes. In short, a Unix domain socket will be visible in the filesystem and will persist until unlinked. On Windows, the local domain is implemented using a named pipe. The path must refer to an entry in \\\\?\\pipe\\ or \\\\.\\pipe\\. Any characters are permitted, but the latter may do some processing of pipe names, such as resolving .. sequences. Despite how it might look, the pipe namespace is flat. Pipes will not persist. They are removed when the last reference to them is closed. Unlike Unix domain sockets, Windows will close and remove the pipe when the owning process exits.

In flowing mode, data is read from the underlying system automatically and provided to an application as quickly as possible using events via the EventEmitter interface.   In paused mode, the stream.read() method must be called explicitly to read chunks of data from the stream.   All Readable streams begin in paused mode but can be switched to flowing mode in one of the following ways:  Adding a 'data' event handler. Calling the stream.resume() method. Calling the stream.pipe() method to send the data to a Writable.  The Readable can switch back to paused mode using one of the following:  If there are no pipe destinations, by calling the stream.pause() method. If there are pipe destinations, by removing all pipe destinations. Multiple pipe destinations may be removed by calling the stream.unpipe() method.  The important concept to remember is that a Readable will not generate data until a mechanism for either consuming or ignoring that data is provided. If the consuming mechanism is disabled or taken away, the Readable will attempt to stop generating the data. For backward compatibility reasons, removing 'data' event handlers will not automatically pause the stream. Also, if there are piped destinations, then calling stream.pause() will not guarantee that the stream will remain paused once those destinations drain and ask for more data. If a Readable is switched into flowing mode and there are no consumers available to handle the data, that data will be lost. This can occur, for instance, when the readable.resume() method is called without a listener attached to the 'data' event, or when a 'data' event handler is removed from the stream.

The callback function must be called synchronously inside of writable._write() or asynchronously (i.e. different tick) to signal either that the write completed successfully or failed with an error. The first argument passed to the callback must be the Error object if the call failed or null if the write succeeded. All calls to writable.write() that occur between the time writable._write() is called and the callback is called will cause the written data to be buffered. When the callback is invoked, the stream might emit a 'drain' event. If a stream implementation is capable of processing multiple chunks of data at once, the writable._writev() method should be implemented.

Rather than waiting for calls to the stream.read() method, 'data' events would begin emitting immediately. Applications that would need to perform some amount of work to decide how to handle data were required to store read data into buffers so the data would not be lost. The stream.pause() method was advisory, rather than guaranteed. This meant that it was still necessary to be prepared to receive 'data' events even when the stream was in a paused state.  In Node.js 0.10, the Readable class was added. For backward compatibility with older Node.js programs, Readable streams switch into \"flowing mode\" when a 'data' event handler is added, or when the stream.resume() method is called. The effect is that, even when not using the new stream.read() method and 'readable' event, it is no longer necessary to worry about losing 'data' chunks. While most applications will continue to function normally, this introduces an edge case in the following conditions:  No 'data' event listener is added. The stream.resume() method is never called. The stream is not piped to any writable destination.  For example, consider the following code: \/\/ WARNING!  BROKEN! net.createServer((socket) => {    \/\/ We add an 'end' listener, but never consume the data.   socket.on('end', () => {     \/\/ It will never get here.     socket.end('The message was received but was not processed.\\n');   });  }).listen(1337);  Prior to Node.js 0.10, the incoming message data would be simply discarded. However, in Node.js 0.10 and beyond, the socket remains paused forever. The workaround in this situation is to call the stream.resume() method to begin the flow of data: \/\/ Workaround. net.createServer((socket) => {   socket.on('end', () => {     socket.end('The message was received but was not processed.\\n');   });    \/\/ Start the flow of data, discarding it.   socket.resume(); }).listen(1337);  In addition to new Readable streams switching into flowing mode, pre-0.10 style streams can be wrapped in a Readable class using the readable.wrap() method."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_highwatermark_discrepancy_after_calling_readable_setencoding","title":"`highWaterMark` discrepancy after calling `readable.setEncoding()`","description":"The use of readable.setEncoding() will change the behavior of how the highWaterMark operates in non-object mode.

The amount of data potentially buffered depends on the highWaterMark option passed into the stream's constructor. For normal streams, the highWaterMark option specifies a total number of bytes. For streams operating in object mode, the highWaterMark specifies a total number of objects. Data is buffered in Readable streams when the implementation calls stream.push(chunk). If the consumer of the Stream does not call stream.read(), the data will sit in the internal queue until it is consumed. Once the total size of the internal read buffer reaches the threshold specified by highWaterMark, the stream will temporarily stop reading data from the underlying resource until the data currently buffered can be consumed (that is, the stream will stop calling the internal readable._read() method that is used to fill the read buffer). Data is buffered in Writable streams when the writable.write(chunk) method is called repeatedly. While the total size of the internal write buffer is below the threshold set by highWaterMark, calls to writable.write() will return true. Once the size of the internal buffer reaches or exceeds the highWaterMark, false will be returned. A key goal of the stream API, particularly the stream.pipe() method, is to limit the buffering of data to acceptable levels such that sources and destinations of differing speeds will not overwhelm the available memory. The highWaterMark option is a threshold, not a limit: it dictates the amount of data that a stream buffers before it stops asking for more data. It does not enforce a strict memory limitation in general. Specific stream implementations may choose to enforce stricter limits but doing so is optional. Because Duplex and Transform streams are both Readable and Writable, each maintains two separate internal buffers used for reading and writing, allowing each side to operate independently of the other while maintaining an appropriate and efficient flow of data. For example, net.Socket instances are Duplex streams whose Readable side allows consumption of data received from the socket and whose Writable side allows writing data to the socket. Because data may be written to the socket at a faster or slower rate than data is received, each side should operate (and buffer) independently of the other."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_object_mode","title":"Object Mode","description":"All streams created by Node.js APIs operate exclusively on strings and Buffer (or Uint8Array) objects.

Certificates are public keys that correspond to a private key, and that are digitally signed either by a Certificate Authority or by the owner of the private key (such certificates are referred to as \"self-signed\"). The first step to obtaining a certificate is to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file. The OpenSSL command-line interface can be used to generate a CSR for a private key: openssl req -new -sha256 -key ryans-key.pem -out ryans-csr.pem  Once the CSR file is generated, it can either be sent to a Certificate Authority for signing or used to generate a self-signed certificate. Creating a self-signed certificate using the OpenSSL command-line interface is illustrated in the example below: openssl x509 -req -in ryans-csr.pem -signkey ryans-key.pem -out ryans-cert.pem  Once the certificate is generated, it can be used to generate a .pfx or .p12 file: openssl pkcs12 -export -in ryans-cert.pem -inkey ryans-key.pem \\       -certfile ca-cert.pem -out ryans.pfx  Where:  in: is the signed certificate inkey: is the associated private key certfile: is a concatenation of all Certificate Authority (CA) certs into a single file, e.g. cat ca1-cert.pem ca2-cert.pem > ca-cert.pem"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_perfect_forward_secrecy","title":"Perfect Forward Secrecy","description":"The term \"Forward Secrecy\" or \"Perfect Forward Secrecy\" describes a feature of key-agreement (i.e., key-exchange) methods. That is, the server and client keys are used to negotiate new temporary keys that are used specifically and only for the current communication session. Practically, this means that even if the server's private key is compromised, communication can only be decrypted by eavesdroppers if the attacker manages to obtain the key-pair specifically generated for the session. Perfect Forward Secrecy is achieved by randomly generating a key pair for key-agreement on every TLS\/SSL handshake (in contrast to using the same key for all sessions). Methods implementing this technique are called \"ephemeral\". Currently two methods are commonly used to achieve Perfect Forward Secrecy (note the character \"E\" appended to the traditional abbreviations):  DHE: An ephemeral version of the Diffie Hellman key-agreement protocol. ECDHE: An ephemeral version of the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key-agreement protocol.  Ephemeral methods may have some performance drawbacks, because key generation is expensive. To use Perfect Forward Secrecy using DHE with the tls module, it is required to generate Diffie-Hellman parameters and specify them with the dhparam option to tls.createSecureContext(). The following illustrates the use of the OpenSSL command-line interface to generate such parameters: openssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dhparam.pem 2048  If using Perfect Forward Secrecy using ECDHE, Diffie-Hellman parameters are not required and a default ECDHE curve will be used. The ecdhCurve property can be used when creating a TLS Server to specify the list of names of supported curves to use, see tls.createServer() for more info.

It uses a pre-shared key instead of certificates to authenticate a TLS connection, providing mutual authentication. TLS-PSK and public key infrastructure are not mutually exclusive. Clients and servers can accommodate both, choosing either of them during the normal cipher negotiation step. TLS-PSK is only a good choice where means exist to securely share a key with every connecting machine, so it does not replace PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) for the majority of TLS uses. The TLS-PSK implementation in OpenSSL has seen many security flaws in recent years, mostly because it is used only by a minority of applications. Please consider all alternative solutions before switching to PSK ciphers. Upon generating PSK it is of critical importance to use sufficient entropy as discussed in RFC 4086. Deriving a shared secret from a password or other low-entropy sources is not secure. PSK ciphers are disabled by default, and using TLS-PSK thus requires explicitly specifying a cipher suite with the ciphers option. The list of available ciphers can be retrieved via openssl ciphers -v 'PSK'. All TLS 1.3 ciphers are eligible for PSK but currently only those that use SHA256 digest are supported they can be retrieved via openssl ciphers -v -s -tls1_3 -psk. According to the RFC 4279, PSK identities up to 128 bytes in length and PSKs up to 64 bytes in length must be supported.

The process can be sped up by saving and later reusing the session state. There are several mechanisms to do so, discussed here from oldest to newest (and preferred). Session Identifiers Servers generate a unique ID for new connections and send it to the client. Clients and servers save the session state. When reconnecting, clients send the ID of their saved session state and if the server also has the state for that ID, it can agree to use it. Otherwise, the server will create a new session. See RFC 2246 for more information, page 23 and 30. Resumption using session identifiers is supported by most web browsers when making HTTPS requests. For Node.js, clients wait for the 'session' event to get the session data, and provide the data to the session option of a subsequent tls.connect() to reuse the session. Servers must implement handlers for the 'newSession' and 'resumeSession' events to save and restore the session data using the session ID as the lookup key to reuse sessions. To reuse sessions across load balancers or cluster workers, servers must use a shared session cache (such as Redis) in their session handlers. Session Tickets The servers encrypt the entire session state and send it to the client as a \"ticket\". When reconnecting, the state is sent to the server in the initial connection. This mechanism avoids the need for server-side session cache. If the server doesn't use the ticket, for any reason (failure to decrypt it, it's too old, etc.), it will create a new session and send a new ticket. See RFC 5077 for more information. Resumption using session tickets is becoming commonly supported by many web browsers when making HTTPS requests. For Node.js, clients use the same APIs for resumption with session identifiers as for resumption with session tickets. For debugging, if tls.TLSSocket.getTLSTicket() returns a value, the session data contains a ticket, otherwise it contains client-side session state. With TLSv1.3, be aware that multiple tickets may be sent by the server, resulting in multiple 'session' events, see 'session' for more information. Single process servers need no specific implementation to use session tickets. To use session tickets across server restarts or load balancers, servers must all have the same ticket keys. There are three 16-byte keys internally, but the tls API exposes them as a single 48-byte buffer for convenience. Its possible to get the ticket keys by calling server.getTicketKeys() on one server instance and then distribute them, but it is more reasonable to securely generate 48 bytes of secure random data and set them with the ticketKeys option of tls.createServer(). The keys should be regularly regenerated and server's keys can be reset with server.setTicketKeys(). Session ticket keys are cryptographic keys, and they must be stored securely. With TLS 1.2 and below, if they are compromised all sessions that used tickets encrypted with them can be decrypted. They should not be stored on disk, and they should be regenerated regularly. If clients advertise support for tickets, the server will send them. The server can disable tickets by supplying require('constants').SSL_OP_NO_TICKET in secureOptions. Both session identifiers and session tickets timeout, causing the server to create new sessions. The timeout can be configured with the sessionTimeout option of tls.createServer(). For all the mechanisms, when resumption fails, servers will create new sessions. Since failing to resume the session does not cause TLS\/HTTPS connection failures, it is easy to not notice unnecessarily poor TLS performance. The OpenSSL CLI can be used to verify that servers are resuming sessions. Use the -reconnect option to openssl s_client, for example: $ openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -reconnect  Read through the debug output. The first connection should say \"New\", for example: New, TLSv1.2, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256  Subsequent connections should say \"Reused\", for example: Reused, TLSv1.2, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_modifying_the_default_tls_cipher_suite","title":"Modifying the Default TLS Cipher suite","description":"Node.js is built with a default suite of enabled and disabled TLS ciphers.

For instance, the following makes ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4 the default TLS cipher suite: node --tls-cipher-list='ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4' server.js  export NODE_OPTIONS=--tls-cipher-list='ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4' node server.js  The default can also be replaced on a per client or server basis using the ciphers option from tls.createSecureContext(), which is also available in tls.createServer(), tls.connect(), and when creating new tls.TLSSockets. The ciphers list can contain a mixture of TLSv1.3 cipher suite names, the ones that start with 'TLS_', and specifications for TLSv1.2 and below cipher suites. The TLSv1.2 ciphers support a legacy specification format, consult the OpenSSL cipher list format documentation for details, but those specifications do not apply to TLSv1.3 ciphers. The TLSv1.3 suites can only be enabled by including their full name in the cipher list. They cannot, for example, be enabled or disabled by using the legacy TLSv1.2 'EECDH' or '!EECDH' specification. Despite the relative order of TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 cipher suites, the TLSv1.3 protocol is significantly more secure than TLSv1.2, and will always be chosen over TLSv1.2 if the handshake indicates it is supported, and if any TLSv1.3 cipher suites are enabled. The default cipher suite included within Node.js has been carefully selected to reflect current security best practices and risk mitigation. Changing the default cipher suite can have a significant impact on the security of an application. The --tls-cipher-list switch and ciphers option should by used only if absolutely necessary. The default cipher suite prefers GCM ciphers for Chrome's 'modern cryptography' setting and also prefers ECDHE and DHE ciphers for Perfect Forward Secrecy, while offering some backward compatibility. 128 bit AES is preferred over 192 and 256 bit AES in light of specific attacks affecting larger AES key sizes. Old clients that rely on insecure and deprecated RC4 or DES-based ciphers (like Internet Explorer 6) cannot complete the handshaking process with the default configuration. If these clients must be supported, the TLS recommendations may offer a compatible cipher suite. For more details on the format, see the OpenSSL cipher list format documentation. There are only 5 TLSv1.3 cipher suites:  'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384' 'TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256' 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256' 'TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256' 'TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256'  The first 3 are enabled by default.

In actual practice, use a pool of Workers instead for these kinds of tasks. Otherwise, the overhead of creating Workers would likely exceed their benefit. When implementing a worker pool, use the AsyncResource API to inform diagnostic tools (e.g. in order to provide asynchronous stack traces) about the correlation between tasks and their outcomes. See \"Using AsyncResource for a Worker thread pool\" in the async_hooks documentation for an example implementation. Worker threads inherit non-process-specific options by default. Refer to Worker constructor options to know how to customize worker thread options, specifically argv and execArgv options."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_worker_markasuntransferable_object","title":"`worker.markAsUntransferable(object)`","description":"Mark an object as not transferable.

However, if it is known that the data is incomplete, or the desire is to inspect only the beginning of a compressed file, it is possible to suppress the default error handling by changing the flushing method that is used to decompress the last chunk of input data: \/\/ This is a truncated version of the buffer from the above examples const buffer = Buffer.from('eJzT0yMA', 'base64');  zlib.unzip(   buffer,   \/\/ For Brotli, the equivalent is zlib.constants.BROTLI_OPERATION_FLUSH.   { finishFlush: zlib.constants.Z_SYNC_FLUSH },   (err, buffer) => {     if (err) {       console.error('An error occurred:', err);       process.exitCode = 1;     }     console.log(buffer.toString());   });  This will not change the behavior in other error-throwing situations, e.g. when the input data has an invalid format. Using this method, it will not be possible to determine whether the input ended prematurely or lacks the integrity checks, making it necessary to manually check that the decompressed result is valid."},{"url":"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/all.html#all_flushing","title":"Flushing","description":"Calling .flush() on a compression stream will make zlib return as much output as currently possible.
